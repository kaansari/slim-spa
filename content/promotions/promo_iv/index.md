title: "Botox"
description: "During the treatment, one of our skilled providers gently moves the Microneedling device over the skin, creating micro-injuries. These tiny injuries activate the body's natural wound healing response, stimulating the production of collagen and elastin. Following the Microneedling session, the skin may appear slightly red and swollen. Rest assured, these effects are temporary and typically subside within a few days."
