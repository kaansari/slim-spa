| Name                    | Botox (short for Botulinum)                                                           |
| Type                    | Neurotoxin                                                                                  |
| Medical Uses            | 1. Cosmetic procedures to reduce wrinkles and fine lines.                                    |
|                         | 2. Medical treatments for conditions like migraines, muscle spasms, and hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating). |
| How it Works            | Botox temporarily paralyzes muscles by blocking nerve signals. This reduces muscle activity, which smoothens wrinkles and alleviates certain medical conditions. |
| Administration          | Typically injected into the target muscle using a fine needle.                               |
| Effect Duration         | Effects last for several months (usually 3 to 4 months).                                    |
| Side Effects            | 1. Temporary pain or discomfort at the injection site.                                      |
|                         | 2. Possible mild bruising or swelling.                                                      |
|                         | 3. Rarely, more severe side effects like drooping eyelids or difficulty swallowing.         |
| Safety Considerations   | It should only be administered by a licensed medical professional.                            |
|                         | Patients should avoid rubbing the injection site to prevent spreading the toxin.           |
|                         | Botox is not recommended during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.                           |
| Cost                    | The cost varies based on the number of units used and the location, but it is typically per unit or per treatment area. |
| Popularity              | Botox is one of the most popular non-surgical cosmetic procedures worldwide.               |
| Manufacturer            | Various pharmaceutical companies produce Botox, including Allergan, a subsidiary of AbbVie.   |
