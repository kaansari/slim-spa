title: "Micorneedling"
description: "During the treatment, one of our skilled providers gently moves the state of the art Microneedling golden pen over the skin, creating micro-injuries. These tiny injuries activate the body's natural wound healing response, stimulating the production of collagen and elastin. Following the Microneedling session, the skin may appear slightly red and swollen. Rest assured, these effects are temporary and typically subside within a few days."

Microneedling works wonders in improving overall skin texture and tone. It effectively reduces the appearance of enlarged pores, refines rough skin, and evens out uneven pigmentation, such as age spots or sun damage. The procedure promotes natural cell turnover, resulting in fresher, smoother, and more evenly-toned skin.
