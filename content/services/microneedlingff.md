At Sculpt and Glow, our most favored treatment is Microneedling, a cutting-edge skin rejuvenation procedure that triggers the production of collagen and elastin. Microneedling works wonders in improving overall skin texture and tone. It effectively reduces the appearance of enlarged pores, refines rough skin, and evens out uneven pigmentation, such as age spots or sun damage. The procedure promotes natural cell turnover, resulting in fresher, smoother, and more evenly-toned skin.

During the treatment, one of our skilled providers gently moves the Microneedling device over the skin, creating micro-injuries. These tiny injuries activate the body's natural wound healing response, stimulating the production of collagen and elastin. Following the Microneedling session, the skin may appear slightly red and swollen. Rest assured, these effects are temporary and typically subside within a few days.

While you may notice initial improvements, the full results of Microneedling may take several weeks to become apparent in your skin's texture, tone, and overall appearance. Depending on your specific goals and skin condition, multiple sessions, usually spaced several weeks apart, may be recommended to achieve the optimal and desired outcome.

Our team is dedicated to helping you achieve the best results and uncovering the true potential of your skin through Microneedling. Schedule your appointment today or call us at (312) 285 2897 for any further questions or additional information.
