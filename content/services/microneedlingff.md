Microneedling works wonders in improving overall skin texture and tone. It effectively reduces the appearance of enlarged pores, refines rough skin, and helps with hyperpigmentation, such as age spots or sun damage. The procedure promotes natural cell turnover, resulting in fresher, smoother, and more evenly-toned skin.
